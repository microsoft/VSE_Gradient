Code repo for the paper "Dissecting Deep Metric Learning Losses for Image-Text Retrieval"

The main code is in /Gradient folder

And /Expample folder contains an example to plug gradient method in a VSE-infy work.

/Expample/vse_infy is cloned and inherited from the repo: https://github.com/woodfrog/vse_infty 

Example train code is /Expample/vse_infy/train_region.sh and evaluation code is /Expample/vse_infy/eval_region.sh
